# Your Linkedin Resume


You've learned an awful lot about programming - now it's time to show employers what you know, and where you could fit in with their companies. We'll start off by taking a break from coding to write your resume.

If you don't already have an up-to-date, good-looking resume, we suggest starting by making a LinkedIn profile, which you can then use to generate a resume. Many employers will actually ask for your LinkedIn profile in lieu of a resume. We suggest you lay out your LinkedIn profile like this:

* 
Include a nice formal photo.
* 
Edit your tagline to be something like "Seeking Front end Developer position", "Student at Opteamize, an IBM Coding School", "Intern at {{your_internship}}", or something along those lines.
* 
Edit your public profile URL on the right side bar by including your name E.g. www.linkedin.com/in/mattwilliams85
* 
Write a short summary of what you're doing now (learning to code) and why you decided to become a developer. Keep it under five sentences.
* 
Add a link to your Github and Stackoverflow profiles and optionally your website to your summary.
* 
Move the Projects section just below your summary, and add your Opteamize projects, including your internship project on top. Include links to the Github code and your live app site on IBM Cloud.
* 
Talk about what the projects do and what technologies you used.
* 
Next, list your previous jobs under experience, with a short description of what you did at each role. 
* 
Add Opteamize to your Education section, and move that section to come after your Experience section. Write a little bit about what you're learning and doing at Opteamize.  
* 
In the Skills section, list skills you've learned at Opteamize, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, SQL, Android, Java, AJAX, Git, TDD, and pair programming.
* 
Don't include months in any of the dates - just years.

After you finish updating your profile, check it out in an incognito window in Chrome to make sure you have all of the settings correct so that your information is publicly visible.
