## Welcome

Hi! Welcome to FastTrack course for Frontend Development. This is a step-by-step guide to take you from zero experience to Front End Developer and contains everything you need, including lessons and practice exercises. The content you see here is the same curriculum at Epicodus, a Coding School in Portland, OR \(USA\).

**Curriculum**  
The curriculum has a strong focus on all of the skills required of Front End Developers today and is crafted to simulate a real job environment, exposing students to broken tests, incomplete documentation and other surprises that give them experience with the sorts of real-world challenges that many Engineers only encounter late in their careers.

If learning how to program sounds a bit overwhelming, don't worry! The curriculum is broken down so that each step along the way is small and manageable. All you need to do is follow along and do the exercises. Note: if you don't do the exercises, all of this is pointless. **You can't learn to program by watching somebody else. You have to actually do it yourself.**

Check out the table of contents to see an overview of all the sections.

**Level 1 - Introduction and Beginner**  
Level 1 is designed to take you from zero experience to being able to create a basic web page that displays information with the presentation language HTML and style it with CSS. Understand the basics of Javascript and get a good understanding of jQuery.

**Level 2 - Technical**  
By the second level of the course, students would have honed the ability to thrive within the constantly shifting software engineering landscape, frequently working on projects based on technologies not explicitly covered in our curriculum. Get a better understanding of Javascript.

**Level 3 - Assignments and TODOs**  
The program culminates with student live projects, so that students have the ability to articulate their skills to be used in real-world scenarios.

Okay, let's get going; All the best!
