# True to Form


Start your day off by following along and completing the Example section of Mozilla's form-styling tutorial (see last night's homework). Do not copy and paste.

Nobody enjoys filling out forms, but developers and designers can help make users' experience a little more pleasant with some styling. Check out [this](http://codepen.io/ehermanson/details/KwKWEv/) and [this](http://codepen.io/nickhaskell/details/HoGsm/). As you can see, filling out forms doesn't have to be a dreary experience. Take some notes! Your next task is to craft some forms of your own.

Start with a basic sign-up or contact form. Get creative with your CSS. [Style your UI](https://dev.opera.com/articles/beautiful-ui-styling-with-css3/). Experiment with basic pseudo classes like a:hover.
When you're done with that, create and style something a little more sophisticated, like [this one](http://cdn3.tympanus.net/codrops/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/registration/). Make it look like something an actual client would use in production.
