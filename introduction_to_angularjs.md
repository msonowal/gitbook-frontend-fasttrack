# Introduction to AngularJS

# AngularJS objectives

In this section we will be using AngularJS to develop interactive front end without all of the jQuery. We will start by integrating AngularJS into our apps to add to a list and display that list. We will learn about controllers and directives. Then we will learn how to use multiple controllers in our applications and how to create factories to share data between controllers. Next we will look at using AngularUI Router to create nested states and routes in our application so that our website can have multiple pages. Finally, we're going to learn how to write reusable custom directives, to make our pages simple to write, and extremely flexible.
