# JavaScript basics objectives

In this section, we will be learning the basics of JavaScript, the programming language of the web. JavaScript allows us to interact with the webpage's user. When learning any language, we must start with the basic building blocks and for JavaScript these include:

- Arithmetic
- Variables
- Methods
- Strings
- Functions

We will be working almost exclusively in the JavaScript Console this week. Make sure you are familiar with how to access it.
