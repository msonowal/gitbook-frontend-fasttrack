# Your Github Resume


## **GitHub Is Your Resume Now**


If you’re a programmer, the days of sending a CV when you apply for a job are quickly coming to an end, if they haven’t already.We just want to see what you’ve built and how you built it, and the best way to see that is by looking at your GitHub account.

The problem is that while most programmers seem to understand and even embrace GitHub as the new resume, few if any seem to have actually put any thought or time into making their GitHub accounts look and work well as such.

GitHub is more than just your social backup storage, it’s your portfolio and it’s public. You can’t just dump everything there willy-nilly or your account is going to look like shit, which it probably does.

Like it or not, GitHub is your resume now, and the projects you choose to show tell everything about you, especially where you are spending your time and how wisely. Don’t waste your time building unimportant things. Identify a serious problem and write some really good, well-tested code that makes it better. Then put it on GitHub so the world can see, keeping in mind the issues we just outlined. Take good care of your GitHub account and it will take good care of you.

So here are some really obvious things that most people do wrong with their GitHub accounts. Hopefully it’ll help.

**Too many forked repositories**
### 

There’s nothing more annoying than looking at someone’s GitHub account and seeing a bunch of forked repositories. 

**Sharing anything and everything**
### 

GitHub is your portfolio. A common mistake designers and artists make is adding anything and everything they’ve ever done to their portfolios, and then never getting rid of anything.  Don’t make the same mistake with your GitHub account. Be judicious about what you add; you have to curate your work, otherwise your signal-to-noise ratio drops.


**Missing or unclear descriptions**

Every project needs a clear, concise description. I don’t want to have to read all your code in order to divine what your project does. If you can’t tell me in one sentence what your project does, then you probably don’t even understand the problem well-enough to be solving it.

**Old repositories**
### 

The work you did a year or more ago couldn’t possibly still be relevant today. If it is, you aren’t working hard enough or learning fast enough. Get rid of anything you haven’t worked on in over a year.

**Mediocre code**
### 

Quantity never trumps quality. If I see a few projects with mediocre code I just extrapolate and assume all the projects are mediocre and stop looking. I’d rather see two really good projects and nothing else than eight mediocre ones mixed in with three good ones. Only add projects to your account if you truly think it’s great or useful work.
