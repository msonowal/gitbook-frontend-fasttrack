The interview is one of the most important steps in the job search process. It is your chance to elaborate on how your education, skills, and experience fit what the employer is seeking in a candidate and ultimately gets you the job offer. The keys to interviewing success are researching the employer, knowing yourself, and preparing for and following-up after the interview.

**Research**

We cannot stress enough how important research is. The research  about the potential employer should really go beyond the technical aspects of the company. The more knowledge and investment you have in them, the more buy in they’ll have with you. Here are some things you should do before your interview:

* Know what type of interview to expect (i.e. initial screening interview, telephone interview, Group discussion, second/site interview, panel interview, Technical interview, HR interview)and prepare accordingly.
* You  should be able to discuss your skills, interests, values and goals that relate to the position
* Demonstrate that you have the necessary position requirements
* Be prepared to respond to common interview questions
* Research about the company:
  * What services/solutions do they make/provide?
  * Who works there? Check the team page
  * Find all their locations from Contact Us page
  * Look up their key executives on LinkedIn
  * Look the developers up on Github
  * Interact with their product and submit feedback if possible
  * Download their app
  * Use their API
  * Browse their client sites
  * Follow the company and employees on Twitter
  * Like the company on Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.
  * Check reviews on Glassdoor

**Know What To Wear for the Interview**

 It is important to know what to wear to an interview and to be well-groomed. Whether you wear a suit or something less formal depends on the company culture and the position you are seeking. If possible, call to find out about the company dress code before the interview.

**Men**
* Wear a clean, pressed shirt or suit (if required)
* Wear black or brown leather shoes
* Present a clean-shaven or neatly trimmed beard

**Women**
* Wear a clean, pressed pants, saree or salwar kameez
* Wear black or brown leather shoes or flat chappals
* Hair should be neatly arranged
 
**Gather What To Bring**
* Professional folder to carry documents
* Extra copies of your resume
* Samples of your relevant work
* Pen and notebook

**On the day of the Interview**

* Be on time;plan to arrive 10-15 minutes before your interview is to begin
* Turn off your cell phone when called in for the interview.


## **During the Interview**

**Good nonverbal communication**

It's about demonstrating confidence: standing or sitting straight, making eye contact and connecting with a firm handshake. That first nonverbal impression can be a great beginning or quick ending to your interview.

* Make a good first impression
* Extend a firm handshake and use appropriate salutation (Sir, M’am)
* Maintain eye contact with the interviewer during your greeting and throughout the interview

**Listen**

From the very beginning of the interview, your interviewer is giving you information, either directly or indirectly. If you are not hearing it, you are missing a major opportunity. Good communication skills include listening and letting the person know you heard what was said. Observe your interviewer, and match that style and pace.

**Don't talk too much**

Telling the interviewer more than he needs to know could be a fatal mistake. When you have not prepared ahead of time, you may ramble when answering interview questions, sometimes talking yourself right out of the job. Prepare for the interview by reading through the job posting, matching your skills with the position's requirements and relating only that information.

**Don't be too familiar**

The interview is a professional meeting to talk business. This is not about making a new friend. Your level of familiarity should mimic the interviewer's demeanor. It is important to bring energy and enthusiasm to the interview and to ask questions, but do not overstep your place as a candidate looking for a job.

**Use appropriate language**

It's a given that you should use professional language during the interview. Be aware of any inappropriate slang words or references to age, race, religion, politics or sexual orientation -- these topics could send you out the door very quickly.

**Don't be over confident**

Attitude plays a key role in your interview success. There is a fine balance between confidence, professionalism and modesty. Even if you're putting on a performance to demonstrate your ability, overconfidence is as bad, if not worse, as being too reserved.

**Take care to answer the questions**

When interviewers ask for an example of a time when you did something, they are asking behavioral interview questions, which are designed to elicit a sample of your past behavior. If you fail to relate a specific example, you not only don't answer the question, but you also miss an opportunity to prove your ability and talk about your skills.

**Ask questions**

When asked if they have any questions, most candidates answer, "No." Wrong answer. Part of knowing how to interview is being ready to ask questions that demonstrate an interest in what goes on in the company. Asking questions also gives you the opportunity to find out if this is the right place for you. The best questions come from listening to what you're asked during the interview and asking for additional information.

**Don't appear desperate**

When you interview with the "please, please hire me" approach, you appear desperate and less confident. Reflect the three Cs during the interview: cool, calm and confidence. You know you can do the job; make sure the interviewer believes you can, too.

### **After the Interview**

* Send a prompt thank-you email for the interview
* Follow-up regarding your status in the process if the employer has not contacted you within the agreed upon time frame (you can initiate contact and ask if a hiring decision has been made)
* Continue applying for additional opportunities

### **Top 10 Interview tips **

1. 	Do your homework on the job, the organization, the competition and the industry. Reading the website is the minimum. Most students don't read business magazines, newspapers or trade journals, so when you do, you'll stand out from the crowd. Doing this homework will prevent you from asking really obvious  and naïve questions.
2.     	Anticipate and prepare for the typical questions with strong personal answers. "Tell me about yourself." "What are your strengths and weaknesses?" "Tell me about your greatest accomplishments." "Tell me about your Final year project?" "Why do you want this job?" "Why this organization?" Have your answers and examples so well rehearsed that it's natural.
3.     	Develop 5-7 adaptable stories from your resume related to the job you're seeking. Start with the situation by describing the context and problem. Then explain what you did to improve the situation and describe the results in quantifiable terms. This demonstrates that you understand the importance and the impact of your personal contributions. With these stories prepared in advance, you can adapt them to various questions.
4.     	Frame your answers to show how you will add value to the organization. Many students too often focus on why they want the job, what they will get out of it, and why it will be good for them. Turn the tables and explain how and why you can and will benefit the organization. 
5.     	Use the right vocabulary. Surprise an employer by actually being able to translate how your academic or extracurricular experiences have helped to prepare you for the role you're interviewing for - using key words in the job description. Very few students can do this. For example, if you were in NCC, describe how you managed the Technical symposium using your project management and leadership skills.
6.     	Prepare two or three questions that demonstrate you prepared in advance about your role in the organisation. Avoid questions where answers are on the website.
7.     	Practice interviewing out loud with mentors, friends or even in front of  the mirror. Most students have not done many (if any) job interviews - and definitely not when under pressure. It's important to hear the words you intend to speak, including the tone, emphasis, inflections and facial impression, so that you don't blow it when it really counts. It's rare to get a second chance.
8.     	Demeanor, humble self-confidence, personality and enthusiasm really matter. Smile! Allow your voice tone, words and body language to communicate your genuine excitement about the opportunity. It will be a significant decision factor for your interviewer. If you don't, your interviewer will question if you really want the job or if you're going to be committed to the organization. This is one of the top reasons why people do not get job offers.
9.     	Don't judge a book by its cover. Many students have difficulty getting excited about entry-level jobs because they feel overqualified or discouraged that the work will not be fulfilling. In each interview, your primary objective is to get invited back for another interview and to eventually secure an offer. As you progress through the process, many find that the job and organization are much more interesting than they originally thought.
10.   	Finish strong and follow up. Always close with a final statement that makes it crystal clear that you are genuinely excited and interested in the opportunity, including why you'd be a great hire and fit for the job and organization. Clarify next steps and the timeline. Email a thank you note less than 24 hours after the interview while it is still fresh on your mind. Articulate your fit and why they should hire you specific to the interview conversations.

**Common Interview Questions**

* Tell me about yourself.
* Keep your answer to one or two minutes
* Give a short version of your resume—general goals, skills and background
* Focus on the skills, experiences and education you will apply to THIS specific position within this organization
Tell me about your strengths and weaknesses.
* Strengths: Relate your skills to the position description (give an example of your strength in action)
* Weaknesses: List a weakness you are working on to improve and does not directly disqualify you from the position (employers want to see that you are self-aware and taking steps to better yourself)
* Why are you interested in our organization? What interests you about this job?
* Share an informed interest and passion: know the organization’s mission, products, size, reputation, history and how your role will support/impact the organization
* Talk about their needs and how you can make a contribution to the company goals
* Where do you see yourself in five years?
* Demonstrate that this position fits into your short and long-term goals
* Be realistic: research the structure of the organization and identify where entry-level employees progress
* Before sharing graduate school plans, research whether the employer supports further education (typically, educational benefits are to be discussed after an offer of employment has been made)

**What Employers look for in candidates**
