# Git with Teams

## Git with Teams

To work on a team project, we need to take advantage of some Git functionality that we haven't needed to use previously on our pair projects: branching and merging.

Below is a broad overview of how your changes can be added to the shared repository for your team project.

The workflow for working in a team follows these steps.

1. Build a repo and make all team members collaborators.
2. Clone master to each pair's desktop creating a local master branch.
3. Create a feature branch locally to work on a new feature.
4. Complete work on feature branch.
5. Pull any changes from remote master to local master. If there are changes, merge master into the feature branch and resolve any conflicts.
6. Push updated, completed branch \(all tests pass, functionality in place\) to remote master.
7. Navigate to branch and create a pull request.
8. Collaborators review new branch code.
9. Merge.
10. Delete feature branch.
